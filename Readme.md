# Rogue Plane

My first ever video game made with Unity for Andriod. Building this game took about ~7 months while working on it ~20-30 hours a week. It included tons of iterations (I don't think much of anything from the MVP made it to the final game), learning and experimentation. I wish I could share the git history and the complete repository, but because I'm using some licensed packages bought from the Unity Asset Store, and excellent 3D models from
[Synty Studios](https://www.syntystudios.com/), what you are seeing is a cleaned up version of the whole source code.

Feel free to try after downloading from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Rastamas.RoguePlane&hl=en&gl=US). I'll be the first to admit that it's for from good but I'm proud of it nonetheless ðŸ˜„

## Lessons learned

* Game development is fun and it's an amazing feeling playing with a game you made.
* It is very rewarding to deviate from the technologies and problems you encounter every day and try something new
* Different aspects of game development is suited for different people. While I admire indie game devs who are capable of building everything themselves, I can't say the same for myself.
